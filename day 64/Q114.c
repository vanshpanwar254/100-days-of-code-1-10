/*
Write a program to take a string s as input. The task is to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Print the length as output.
Input 1:
s = "abcabcbb"
Output 1:
3
Explanation 1:
The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Input 2:
s = "bbbbb"
Output 2:
1
Explanation 2:
The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Input 3:
s = "pwwkew"
Output 3:
3
Explanation 3:
The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
